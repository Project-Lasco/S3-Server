# S3-Server

Server-side repo for a portfolio project by Ayman Benjelloun-Touimi and Jakobi Haskell, both CS students at [Brown University](https://brown.edu).

## Overview

This repo holds the code for an express server that relays requests from the client to S3 for the Lasco Social Media Project. See the [client repo](https:/github.com/Project-Lascaux/Lascaux) for a full description of the Lasco project. 

## Getting Started

To set up the server for local development, follow these instructions:
1. `cd /home/ubuntu/data.lascoapp.com && python3 github_watch.py`

You can also `screen python3 github_watch.py` to run it in the background. The script will watch for changes in github, and pull if necessary.
